# Authorization & RBAC

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system with dynamic permissions, hierarchical roles, feature flags, and audit logging. This exercise demonstrates enterprise-grade authorization patterns for scalable applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Design role-based access control (RBAC) systems
- Implement dynamic permissions and permission inheritance
- Create feature flags and conditional rendering
- Build audit logging for security compliance
- Handle permission-based UI rendering and navigation
- Implement permission caching and optimization

## Key Concepts

### Role & Permission Management
- Hierarchical role inheritance
- Fine-grained permission control
- Conditional and contextual permissions
- Field-level access control

### Dynamic Authorization
- Real-time permission evaluation
- Resource-based access control
- Ownership and department constraints
- Temporal permission handling

### Feature Flag System
- Role and user-based targeting
- Gradual rollout controls
- A/B testing integration
- Conditional feature enabling

### Audit & Compliance
- Comprehensive access logging
- Permission denial tracking
- Security event monitoring
- Compliance reporting

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. RoleManager Class
- Load and cache role definitions with inheritance
- Resolve user permissions through role hierarchy
- Validate role hierarchy for circular dependencies
- Calculate effective permissions with context

### 2. AbilityFactory Class
- Create CASL ability instances from permissions
- Implement conditional permission rules
- Handle field-level permission restrictions
- Apply user-specific contextual conditions

### 3. FeatureFlagManager Class
- Load and evaluate feature flags
- Implement user/role/department targeting
- Handle rollout percentages and A/B testing
- Provide context-aware flag evaluation

### 4. AuditLogger Class
- Log access attempts and permission checks
- Implement batch processing for performance
- Handle automatic log flushing
- Track security events and violations

### 5. PermissionProvider Component
- Set up React Context for permission management
- Integrate CASL with React components
- Provide permission checking functions
- Handle permission caching and updates

### 6. Access Control Components
- Build RoleGuard for role-based rendering
- Create PermissionButton with action logging
- Implement FeatureFlag conditional rendering
- Design ResourceViewer with permission checks

## RBAC Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Role Hierarchy Example
const roles = [
  {
    id: 'viewer',
    permissions: ['read:posts', 'read:comments']
  },
  {
    id: 'editor', 
    inheritsFrom: ['viewer'],
    permissions: ['create:posts', 'update:posts']
  },
  {
    id: 'admin',
    inheritsFrom: ['editor'],
    permissions: ['delete:posts', 'manage:users']
  }
];

// Permission Check Example
<RoleGuard requiredPermissions={[{action: 'update', subject: 'Post'}]}>
  <EditButton />
</RoleGuard>
```

## Feature Flag Pattern

```typescript
// Feature Flag Example
<FeatureFlag flag="advanced-editor">
  <AdvancedEditorComponent />
</FeatureFlag>

// Conditional Logic
if (checkFeatureFlag('beta-features')) {
  // Show beta features
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Validate permissions on both client and server
- Implement proper role hierarchy validation
- Use CASL for consistent permission checking
- Log all permission checks for audit trails
- Cache permissions securely for performance
- Handle permission updates in real-time

## Testing Strategy

- Test role inheritance and permission resolution
- Verify CASL integration and ability creation
- Test feature flag targeting and evaluation
- Validate audit logging and security events
- Check permission caching and performance
- Test access control components

## Production Notes

- Implement server-side permission validation
- Use Redis for permission caching at scale
- Set up real-time permission updates
- Implement proper audit log retention
- Add monitoring for permission failures
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
