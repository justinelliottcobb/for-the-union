# Security Patterns

## Overview

Implement comprehensive frontend security patterns including Content Security Policy (CSP), XSS prevention, secure storage, input validation, and OWASP compliance. This exercise covers enterprise-grade security measures for production applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Prevent XSS attacks with input sanitization
- Design secure storage strategies for sensitive data
- Build comprehensive input validation systems
- Apply OWASP security guidelines and compliance
- Create threat modeling and security assessment tools

## Key Concepts

### Content Security Policy
- Nonce-based script execution
- Strict directive configuration
- Violation reporting and monitoring
- Dynamic source management

### XSS Prevention
- Context-aware output encoding
- HTML sanitization with DOMPurify
- Input validation and filtering
- Pattern detection and blocking

### Secure Storage
- AES encryption for sensitive data
- Key rotation and management
- Expiration and cleanup
- Cross-tab security sync

### Threat Assessment
- Real-time threat detection
- Security posture assessment
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- Compliance reporting

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. CSPHandler Class
- Generate CSP header strings from configuration
- Create and validate cryptographic nonces
- Handle CSP violation reports
- Manage dynamic source additions

### 2. XSSProtection Class
- Implement HTML sanitization with DOMPurify
- Create context-aware input sanitization
- Build URL validation and sanitization
- Detect XSS patterns and attacks

### 3. SecureStorage Class
- Implement AES encryption with secure-ls
- Handle secure data storage and retrieval
- Create encryption key generation and rotation
- Manage data expiration and cleanup

### 4. InputSanitizer Class
- Build comprehensive validation rule system
- Implement SQL and NoSQL injection prevention
- Create file upload validation
- Add rate limiting integration

### 5. SecurityAuditor Class
- Scan for security threats and vulnerabilities
- Generate security reports and metrics
- Assess application security posture
- Detect anomalies and security incidents

### 6. Security Components
- Build SecureForm with CSRF and XSS protection
- Create SecurityDashboard for monitoring
- Implement ContentSanitizer demonstration
- Design SecurityMiddleware for request processing

## CSP Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// CSP Configuration
const cspConfig = {
  defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
  scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'nonce-{nonce}'"],
  styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
  imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"]
};

// Nonce Usage
<script nonce={generateNonce()}>
  // Inline script with nonce
</script>
```

## XSS Prevention Pattern

```typescript
// Input Sanitization
const sanitizedHTML = xssProtection.sanitizeHTML(userInput);

// Context-Aware Encoding
const safeOutput = xssProtection.encodeForContext(data, 'html');

// URL Validation
const safeURL = xssProtection.sanitizeURL(userURL);
```

## Secure Storage Pattern

```typescript
// Encrypted Storage
secureStorage.setSecure('sensitiveData', data, expirationMs);
const data = secureStorage.getSecure('sensitiveData');

// Key Rotation
secureStorage.rotateKeys();
```

## Security Considerations

- Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Use nonces for CSP instead of 'unsafe-inline'
- Sanitize all user input based on context
- Encrypt sensitive data with strong algorithms
- Validate file uploads for malicious content
- Log security events for analysis and alerting

## OWASP Top 10 Coverage

1. **Injection** - Input sanitization and parameterized queries
2. **Broken Authentication** - Secure session management
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Encryption and secure storage
4. **XML External Entities** - Input validation and parsing
5. **Broken Access Control** - Permission-based controls
6. **Security Misconfiguration** - Security headers and CSP
7. **Cross-Site Scripting** - Input sanitization and output encoding
8. **Insecure Deserialization** - Input validation and type checking
9. **Known Vulnerabilities** - Dependency scanning and updates
10. **Insufficient Logging** - Security event logging and monitoring

## Testing Strategy

- Test CSP header generation and nonce validation
- Verify XSS prevention with malicious payloads
- Test encryption and decryption operations
- Validate input sanitization rules
- Check threat detection and reporting
- Test security component integration

## Production Notes

- Implement CSP in report-only mode first
- Use secure headers middleware (Helmet.js)
- Set up automated security scanning
- Implement proper error handling for security events
- Use content security scanners for file uploads
- Monitor security metrics and violations
- Regularly update security dependencies
