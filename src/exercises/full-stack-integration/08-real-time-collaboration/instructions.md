## Background

Real-time collaboration is one of the most challenging aspects of modern web applications. It requires sophisticated algorithms to handle concurrent edits, maintain consistency across clients, and provide a smooth user experience.

Key concepts to master:

### Operational Transforms (OT)

- Ensure convergence across all clients
- Implement transformation functions

### Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
- Alternative to operational transforms
- Mathematically guaranteed convergence
- Handle concurrent operations without conflicts
- Implement text-based CRDTs

### Presence Awareness
- Track user cursors and selections
- Show real-time user activity
- Handle cursor transformations during edits
- Display user information and status

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Operational Transform Engine

Implement the core OT algorithms:

```typescript
interface Operation {
  type: 'insert' | 'delete' | 'retain';
  position: number;
  content?: string;
  length?: number;
  userId: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

class OperationalTransform {
  transform(op1: Operation, op2: Operation): [Operation, Operation];
  transformBatch(operations: Operation[]): Operation[];
  compose(ops: Operation[]): Operation;
  invert(op: Operation, document: string): Operation;
}
```

### 2. CRDT Implementation

Create a text-based CRDT:

```typescript
interface CRDTChar {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  userId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  deleted: boolean;
}

class CRDT {
  constructor(replicaId: string);
  
  insert(position: number, content: string): Operation;
  delete(position: number, length: number): Operation;
  applyOperation(op: Operation): void;
  applyOperations(ops: Operation[]): void;
  getText(): string;
  getOperations(): Operation[];
}
```

### 3. Conflict Resolution

Implement conflict detection and resolution:

```typescript
interface Conflict {
  type: 'insert-insert' | 'delete-modify' | 'concurrent-edit';
  operations: Operation[];
  position: number;
}

interface ResolutionStrategy {
  strategy: 'last-writer-wins' | 'merge' | 'user-choice';
  operations: Operation[];
  metadata?: any;
}

class ConflictResolver {
  constructor(options?: ConflictOptions);
  
  detectConflicts(operations: Operation[]): Conflict[];
  resolve(conflict: Conflict): ResolutionStrategy;
  applyResolution(resolution: ResolutionStrategy): Operation[];
}
```

### 4. Presence Management

Track user presence and cursors:

```typescript
interface UserCursor {
  userId: string;
  position: number;
  selection?: { start: number; end: number };
  color: string;
  name: string;
  lastSeen: Date;
}

class PresenceIndicator {
  updateUserCursor(userId: string, cursor: UserCursor): void;
  transformCursors(operation: Operation): void;
  getAllCursors(): UserCursor[];
  removeUser(userId: string): void;
  cleanupInactiveUsers(timeout: number): void;
}
```

### 5. Version Control

Implement document versioning:

```typescript
interface DocumentVersion {
  id: string;
  operations: Operation[];
  timestamp: Date;
  parentVersion?: string;
  author: string;
}

interface Branch {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  versions: DocumentVersion[];
  head: string;
}

class VersionControl {
  applyOperation(operation: Operation, branchId?: string): void;
  createBranch(name: string, fromVersion?: string): string;
  mergeBranch(sourceBranch: string, targetBranch: string): MergeResult;
  getHistory(branchId?: string): DocumentVersion[];
  getDocumentAtVersion(versionId: string): string;
  getCurrentVersion(): number;
}
```

### 6. useCollaboration Hook

Create the React integration hook:

```typescript
interface CollaborationState {
  document: CRDT;
  cursors: UserCursor[];
  collaborators: string[];
  insertText: (position: number, text: string) => void;
  deleteText: (position: number, length: number) => void;
  setCursor: (position: number, selection?: { start: number; end: number }) => void;
  undo: () => void;
  redo: () => void;
}

function useCollaboration(documentId: string, userId: string): CollaborationState;
```

### 7. CollaborativeEditor Component

Implement the editor interface:

```typescript
interface CollaborativeEditorProps {
  documentId: string;
  userId: string;
  initialContent?: string;
  collaborators?: UserCursor[];
  onContentChange?: (content: string) => void;
  onCursorChange?: (cursor: UserCursor) => void;
}

function CollaborativeEditor(props: CollaborativeEditorProps): JSX.Element;
```
