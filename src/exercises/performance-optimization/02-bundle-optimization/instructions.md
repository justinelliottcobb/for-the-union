# Bundle Splitting & Code Optimization

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (75 minutes)

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand bundle analysis and size optimization techniques
- Master React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting
- Learn dynamic imports and chunk optimization strategies
- Practice route-level and feature-level lazy loading
- Implement progressive loading and resource prioritization
- Monitor bundle performance and loading metrics

## Background

Bundle optimization is crucial for modern web applications. Large JavaScript bundles can significantly impact loading performance, especially on slower networks and devices. This exercise covers advanced techniques for splitting your code into smaller, more manageable chunks that load only when needed.

Key concepts include:

1. **Code Splitting** - Breaking your bundle into smaller chunks
2. **Lazy Loading** - Loading code only when it's needed
3. **Dynamic Imports** - Runtime module loading based on conditions
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Loading features incrementally

## Key Technologies

### React.lazy and Suspense
```typescript
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./Component'));

<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

### Dynamic Imports
```typescript
const loadModule = async () => {
  const { feature } = await import('./feature-module');
  return feature;
};
```

### Bundle Analysis
```typescript
// Monitor chunk loading performance
const trackChunkLoad = (chunkName: string, startTime: number) => {
  const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
  console.log(`Chunk ${chunkName} loaded in ${loadTime}ms`);
};
```

## Exercise Tasks

### 1. Bundle Performance Monitoring (15 minutes)

Implement `useBundlePerformance` hook that tracks:
- Initial bundle size and loading time
- Dynamically loaded chunk information
- Network transfer times for each chunk
- Memory usage impact of loaded modules

```typescript
function useBundlePerformance() {
  // Track performance.navigation and resource timing
  // Monitor dynamic import loading times
  // Calculate bundle size impact
  // Return metrics and analysis utilities
}
```

### 2. Route-Level Code Splitting (15 minutes)

Create lazy-loaded route components:
- Dashboard, Settings, Reports, Profile routes
- Proper Suspense boundaries with meaningful loading states
- Error boundaries for failed chunk loads
- Performance tracking for route transitions

**Challenge:** How do you handle route preloading based on user navigation patterns?

### 3. Dynamic Feature Loading (20 minutes)

Implement `DynamicImportExample` with:
- Charts feature (simulate Chart.js or similar)
- Editor feature (simulate Monaco Editor or similar)
- Analytics feature (simulate analytics dashboard)
- Conditional loading based on user selections
- Performance tracking and error handling

### 4. Progressive Data Grid (15 minutes)

Create `ChunkedDataGrid` with:
- Progressive data loading in chunks
- Intersection Observer for automatic loading
- On-demand loading of grid features (sorting, filtering)
- Virtual scrolling simulation for large datasets

### 5. Resource Preloading Strategy (10 minutes)

Implement `useResourcePreloader` that:
- Preloads likely-needed routes/features
- Adapts to network conditions
- Uses idle time for background loading
- Provides cache warming functionality

## Advanced Challenges

### Bundle Size Analysis
Create utilities to:
- Measure actual bundle impact of loaded chunks
- Compare before/after optimization metrics
- Identify unused code in loaded modules
- Recommend optimization opportunities

### Network-Aware Loading
Implement loading strategies that consider:
- Connection speed and type
- Device capabilities and memory
- User preferences for data saving
- Time-based loading patterns

### Intelligent Preloading
Build systems that:
- Learn from user behavior patterns
- Preload based on route analytics
- Cache strategies for return visits
- Background synchronization

## Testing Your Implementation

Your solution should demonstrate:

1. **Measurable Performance Impact:** Clear before/after bundle size comparisons
2. **Smart Loading Strategies:** Appropriate use of lazy loading vs eager loading
3. **User Experience:** Smooth loading with proper fallback states
4. **Network Efficiency:** Minimal unnecessary downloads
5. **Error Resilience:** Graceful handling of failed chunk loads

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `useBundlePerformance` accurately tracks chunk loading metrics
- [ ] Route-level lazy loading works with proper Suspense boundaries
- [ ] Dynamic feature loading responds to user actions efficiently
- [ ] `ChunkedDataGrid` progressively loads data and features
- [ ] Resource preloading improves perceived performance
- [ ] Error boundaries handle chunk loading failures gracefully
- [ ] Bundle analysis provides actionable optimization insights

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-splitting:** Too many small chunks can hurt performance
2. **Under-splitting:** Large chunks delay critical features
3. **Poor Fallbacks:** Inadequate loading states hurt UX
4. **Missing Error Handling:** Network failures should be graceful
5. **Inefficient Preloading:** Loading unnecessary resources wastes bandwidth

## Real-world Application Patterns

### Route-Based Splitting
```typescript
// Good: Route-level splitting
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'));
const Settings = lazy(() => import('./pages/Settings'));

// Avoid: Overly granular splitting
const Button = lazy(() => import('./components/Button')); // Too small
```

### Feature-Based Splitting
```typescript
// Good: Feature-level splitting
const ChartingFeature = lazy(() => import('./features/charts'));

// Good: Conditional feature loading
const loadAdvancedFeatures = () => {
  if (user.isPremium) {
    return import('./features/premium');
  }
};
```

### Progressive Enhancement
```typescript
// Load core features first, then enhancements
const coreFeatures = await import('./core');
// Background load of enhancement features
setTimeout(() => import('./enhancements'), 1000);
```

## Performance Monitoring

Use these tools and techniques:

1. **Webpack Bundle Analyzer:** Visualize bundle composition
2. **Chrome DevTools:** Monitor network and performance
3. **Web Vitals:** Measure real-world loading performance
4. **Resource Timing API:** Track detailed loading metrics

## Bundle Optimization Strategies

### Vendor Splitting
```typescript
// Separate vendor code from application code
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    cacheGroups: {
      vendor: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
        name: 'vendors',
        chunks: 'all',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Dynamic Chunking
```typescript
// Create chunks based on features
import(/* webpackChunkName: "charts" */ './charts-feature');
import(/* webpackChunkName: "editor" */ './editor-feature');
```

## Core Web Vitals Impact

Your optimizations should improve:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Faster critical resource loading
- **FID (First Input Delay):** Reduced main thread blocking
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Stable loading patterns

Remember: The goal is not just smaller bundles, but better user experience through strategic loading patterns.
