# Design System Architecture & Component Libraries

Build production-ready design systems with comprehensive token management, sophisticated variant systems, and extensible component architectures. Master the patterns used by leading design systems like Material-UI, Chakra UI, and enterprise design systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- **Design scalable design token systems** with theme support and customization
- **Implement sophisticated variant systems** with compound and responsive variants
- **Build extensible component architectures** for large team collaboration
- **Master theme context** and CSS-in-JS integration patterns
- **Create component documentation** and development tooling systems
- **Apply enterprise patterns** for design system governance and evolution

## Key Concepts

### 1. Design Token Architecture
Create a comprehensive token system that serves as the foundation for all design decisions:

```tsx
const tokens = {
  colors: {
    primary: { 50: '#eff6ff', 500: '#3b82f6', 900: '#1e3a8a' },
    semantic: { background: '#ffffff', text: '#1a202c' }
  },
  typography: {
    fontSizes: { xs: '0.75rem', base: '1rem', xl: '1.25rem' },
    fontWeights: { normal: 400, bold: 700 }
  },
  spacing: { 1: '0.25rem', 4: '1rem', 8: '2rem' }
};
```

### 2. Theme Provider System
Implement comprehensive theming with mode switching and token resolution:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider customTokens={myTokens} defaultMode="auto">
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>

// Usage in components
const theme = useTheme();
const buttonColor = theme.resolvedTokens.colors.primary[500];
```

### 3. Variant System Architecture
Create sophisticated variant systems with compound and responsive variants:

```tsx
const buttonVariants = createVariants({
  size: {
    sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',
    lg: 'px-6 py-3 text-base'
  },
  variant: {
    solid: 'font-medium shadow-sm',
    outline: 'font-medium border-2'
  }
});

// Compound variants
<Button size="lg" variant="solid" color="primary" />
```

### 4. Extensible Component Factory
Build component factories that create consistent, themeable components:

```tsx
const Card = createExtensibleComponent('Card', 'div', cardVariants);

// Usage with polymorphic rendering
<Card as="section" variant="elevated" padding={6}>
  <Card.Header>Title</Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>Content</Card.Body>
</Card>
```

### 5. Component Documentation System
Create live documentation with interactive examples:

```tsx
<ComponentDoc 
  component={Button}
  examples={buttonExamples}
  props={propDocumentation}
/>
```

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Design Token System (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
Create a comprehensive token architecture:

- Define `DesignTokens` interface with all token categories
- Implement token merging and transformation utilities
- Create CSS custom property generation
- Support nested token structures and semantic tokens

### Task 2: Theme Provider (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
Build advanced theming capabilities:

- Implement `ThemeProvider` with light/dark mode support
- Create `useTheme` hook for component access
- Handle theme persistence with localStorage
- Support auto mode with system preference detection
- Implement token resolution with custom overrides

### Task 3: Variant System (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
Design sophisticated variant management:

- Create `createVariants` utility for variant configuration
- Support compound variants (size + color combinations)
- Implement responsive variants with breakpoint prefixes
- Optimize performance with class generation caching
- Add runtime variant validation

### Task 4: Extensible Components (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
Build component factory system:

- Create `createExtensibleComponent` factory function
- Support polymorphic rendering with `as` prop
- Integrate variant system with automatic class generation
- Handle ref forwarding and proper TypeScript types
- Add development debugging and validation

### Task 5: Component Documentation (⭐⭐⭐)
Implement documentation generation system:

- Create `ComponentDoc` with live preview capability
- Support interactive examples with code snippets
- Generate prop documentation tables
- Handle multiple example tabs and descriptions
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for code examples

### Task 6: Theme Customization Tools (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
Build visual theme editing interface:

- Create `ThemeCustomizer` for runtime token editing
- Implement color picker for theme color adjustment
- Add mode toggle for light/dark/auto switching
- Support theme export/import functionality
- Provide live preview of theme changes

## Architecture Patterns

### Token-First Design
- Use design tokens as the single source of truth
- Generate CSS custom properties from tokens
- Support token transformation for different modes
- Implement token validation and type safety

### Variant-Driven Components
- Define component variations through configuration
- Support compound variants for complex combinations
- Implement responsive variants with breakpoint awareness
- Optimize variant resolution for performance

### Extensible Architecture
- Create component factories for consistency
- Support customization through well-defined extension points
- Implement proper TypeScript generics for flexibility
- Provide clear upgrade paths for breaking changes

## Testing Strategy

Focus your tests on:

1. **Token resolution** - theme switching and custom token merging
2. **Variant generation** - correct class combinations and edge cases
3. **Component factory** - proper ref forwarding and type safety
4. **Theme persistence** - localStorage and system preference handling
5. **Accessibility** - proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

## Success Criteria

Your implementation should demonstrate:

- ✅ Comprehensive design token architecture
- ✅ Sophisticated variant system with performance optimization
- ✅ Theme provider with mode switching and persistence
- ✅ Extensible component factory with proper TypeScript support
- ✅ Component documentation system with live examples
- ✅ Enterprise-ready patterns for team scalability

## Design System Principles

### Consistency
- Establish clear visual hierarchy through tokens
- Ensure consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- Provide predictable component behavior across the system

### Flexibility
- Support customization without breaking core functionality
- Enable theme customization for different brands/products
- Allow component extension through well-defined APIs

### Developer Experience
- Provide excellent TypeScript support with proper inference
- Include comprehensive documentation with live examples
- Offer debugging tools and helpful error messages

### Performance
- Optimize variant resolution and class generation
- Implement efficient theme switching without flash
- Use CSS custom properties for runtime theme changes

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with tokens** - they form the foundation of everything else
2. **Design for scale** - consider how 50+ developers will use your system
3. **Think in systems** - every decision should be consistent and predictable
4. **Test thoroughly** - design systems are infrastructure for other teams
5. **Document everything** - clear examples and APIs are crucial for adoption

This exercise represents the pinnacle of design system architecture - focus on building production-ready patterns that can scale across large organizations.
