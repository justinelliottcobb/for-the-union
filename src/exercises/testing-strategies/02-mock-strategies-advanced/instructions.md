# Advanced Mock Strategies

**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (75 minutes)

## Learning Objectives

Master sophisticated mocking patterns for external dependencies including API clients, WebSockets, file uploads, and payment services using advanced mocking techniques.

## Key Concepts

- **Module mocking strategies** for external dependencies and third-party libraries
- **API mocking with MSW** (Mock Service Worker) for realistic network simulation
- **Timer and async mocking** for time-dependent and asynchronous operations
- **Partial mocking techniques** for selective dependency replacement
- **Dynamic mock configuration** for different test scenarios
- **Mock state management** and cleanup between test runs

## Implementation Focus

Complete all TODO sections to build:
- HTTP client with interceptors and retry logic
- WebSocket connection management with reconnection
- Mock state management and cleanup
- Realistic error simulation and testing
- Advanced dependency injection patterns

## Tools and Libraries

- **Jest** - Built-in mocking capabilities
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** - Network request mocking
- **jest-mock-extended** - Advanced TypeScript mock utilities

This exercise teaches enterprise-level mocking strategies essential for testing complex systems with external dependencies.
