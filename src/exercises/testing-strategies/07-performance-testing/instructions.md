## Performance Testing Tools Integration

### Jest Performance Testing
```typescript
// Example performance test structure
describe('HeavyComponent Performance', () => {
  it('should render within performance budget', async () => {
    const metrics = await measureComponentPerformance(HeavyComponent, props);
    expect(metrics.renderTime).toBeLessThan(16); // 60 FPS
    expect(metrics.memoryUsage).toBeLessThan(50 * 1024 * 1024); // 50 MB
  });
});
```

### Lighthouse CI Integration
```typescript
// Example Lighthouse CI configuration
const lighthouseConfig = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      numberOfRuns: 3,
      settings: {
        chromeFlags: '--no-sandbox'
      }
    },
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        'categories:performance': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }],
        'audits:first-contentful-paint': ['warn', { maxNumericValue: 2000 }]
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### Bundle Analysis Integration
```typescript
// Example bundle analysis integration
const bundleAnalysis = {
  thresholds: {
    maxAssetSize: 250000,
    maxEntrypointSize: 250000
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: true,
    treeshaking: true
  }
};
```

## Performance Budget Configuration

```typescript
interface PerformanceBudget {
  maxRenderTime: number;        // Maximum render time in ms
  maxMemoryUsage: number;       // Maximum memory usage in bytes
  minFrameRate: number;         // Minimum acceptable frame rate
  maxBundleSize: number;        // Maximum bundle size in bytes
  maxTimeToInteractive: number; // Maximum time to interactive in ms
}
