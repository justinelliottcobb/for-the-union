## Test Architecture Design Patterns

### Framework Architecture Pattern
```typescript
interface TestFrameworkConfig {
  discovery: {
    patterns: string[];
    excludePatterns: string[];
    testCategories: TestCategory[];
  };
  execution: {
    parallel: boolean;
    maxWorkers: number;
    timeout: number;
    retries: number;
  };
  reporting: {
    formats: ReportFormat[];
    outputs: OutputTarget[];
    realTime: boolean;
  };
  integrations: {
    cicd: CICDConfig;
    monitoring: MonitoringConfig;
    notifications: NotificationConfig;
  };
}
```

### Orchestration Pattern
```typescript
interface TestOrchestrationPlan {
  phases: TestPhase[];
  dependencies: DependencyGraph;
  resourceRequirements: ResourceMap;
  executionStrategy: ExecutionStrategy;
  failureHandling: FailureStrategy;
  qualityGates: QualityGate[];
}
```

### Parallel Execution Pattern
```typescript
interface ParallelExecutionStrategy {
  workerAllocation: WorkerAllocationStrategy;
  testDistribution: TestDistributionStrategy;
  resourceSharing: ResourceSharingStrategy;
  faultTolerance: FaultToleranceStrategy;
  scaling: AutoScalingStrategy;
}
```

  beforeDiscovery?: () => void;
  afterDiscovery?: (tests: TestSuite[]) => TestSuite[];
  beforeExecution?: (context: ExecutionContext) => void;
  afterExecution?: (results: TestResults) => void;
  onFailure?: (error: TestError, context: ExecutionContext) => void;

  conditions: QualityCondition[];
  actions: QualityAction[];
  stakeholders: string[];
  blocking: boolean;
}

interface QualityCondition {
  metric: string;
  operator: 'gt' | 'lt' | 'gte' | 'lte' | 'eq' | 'neq';
  threshold: number;
  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'critical';
