# Advanced Error Handling and Resilience

Master sophisticated error handling, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation strategies for robust GraphQL applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement sophisticated error handling strategies
- Build retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Handle partial data and graceful degradation
- Create circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- Design comprehensive error reporting systems

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Basic GraphQL Queries exercise
- Understanding of Promise patterns and async/await
- Familiarity with error handling concepts
- Basic knowledge of network reliability patterns

## Overview

Real-world applications need robust error handling to provide reliable user experiences. GraphQL adds complexity because:

1. **Multiple Error Sources**: Network, GraphQL, validation, and application errors
2. **Partial Data**: Queries can succeed partially with errors
3. **Complex Relationships**: Field errors can cascade through query relationships
4. **Real-time Requirements**: Errors in subscriptions need special handling

## Key Concepts

### Error Classification System

GraphQL applications encounter several error categories:

- **Network Errors**: DNS failures, timeouts, connection issues
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Token expiry, insufficient permissions
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid input data, schema violations
- **Rate Limiting**: API quota exceeded, throttling
- **Server Errors**: Internal server issues, database problems
- **Timeout Errors**: Long-running queries that exceed limits

### Retry Strategies

Different errors require different retry approaches:

- **Exponential Backoff**: For transient network issues
- **Linear Retry**: For predictable temporary issues
- **Circuit Breaking**: To prevent cascading failures
- **No Retry**: For validation and authorization errors

### Graceful Degradation

When full functionality isn't available:

- **Partial Data Usage**: Extract usable information from partial responses
- **Fallback Strategies**: Use cached or default data
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add features as services recover
- **User Communication**: Inform users about limitations

## Exercise Tasks

### Task 1: Error Classification (TODO 1)

Implement `classifyError()` function that:
- Analyzes error sources and types
- Determines retry-ability
- Assigns severity levels
- Provides user-friendly messages
- Includes debugging information

**Key Considerations:**
- Parse GraphQL error extensions for error codes
- Check network error types and status codes
- Distinguish between temporary and permanent failures
- Provide actionable user guidance

### Task 2: Retry Mechanism (TODO 2)

Build `retryWithBackoff()` that implements:
- Configurable retry attempts and delays
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Conditional retry based on error type
- Detailed retry statistics
- Cancellation support

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
interface RetryConfig {
  maxAttempts: number;
  baseDelay: number;
  maxDelay: number;
  backoffMultiplier: number;
  jitter: boolean;
  retryCondition: (error: ClassifiedError, attempt: number) => boolean;
}
```

### Task 3: Circuit Breaker Pattern (TODO 3)

Implement `CircuitBreaker` class with:
- State management (Closed, Open, Half-Open)
- Failure threshold monitoring
- Automatic recovery attempts
- Request statistics tracking
- Configurable reset timeouts

**Circuit States:**
- **Closed**: Normal operation, monitoring failures
- **Open**: Failing fast, blocking requests
- **Half-Open**: Testing recovery with limited requests

### Task 4: Partial Data Handling (TODO 4-5)

Create utilities for:
- Analyzing partial GraphQL responses
- Identifying missing vs available data
- Applying degradation strategies
- Extracting maximum usable information

**Degradation Patterns:**
- **Field-level**: Use available fields, skip missing ones
- **Entity-level**: Show subset of requested entities
- **Feature-level**: Disable features requiring missing data

### Task 5: Request Deduplication (TODO 6)

Build `RequestDeduplicator` that:
- Generates consistent request keys
- Manages pending request promises
- Shares results across duplicate requests
- Handles request timeouts and cleanup

### Task 6: Recovery Strategies (TODO 7)

Implement recovery mechanisms:
- **Cache Recovery**: Serve stale data when queries fail
- **Simplified Queries**: Retry with reduced complexity
- **Alternative Endpoints**: Try backup services
- **Default Values**: Use sensible fallbacks

### Task 7: Error Reporting (TODO 8)

Create comprehensive error reporting:
- **Structured Reports**: Consistent error documentation
- **Contextual Information**: User state, request details
- **Performance Metrics**: Duration, network latency
- **Batch Reporting**: Efficient error aggregation

### Task 8: Resilient Client (TODO 9)

Integrate all patterns into `ResilientGraphQLClient`:
- Unified error handling
- Automatic retry and recovery
- Circuit breaker integration
- Performance monitoring
- Graceful degradation

### Task 9: Testing Framework (TODO 10)

Build testing utilities for:
- Simulating various error conditions
- Verifying retry behavior
- Testing circuit breaker states
- Validating error reporting

## Implementation Guidelines

### Error Processing Pipeline

```typescript
Request → Classify Error → Check Circuit → Apply Retry → 
Attempt Recovery → Apply Degradation → Report Error → Return Result
```

### Retry Decision Matrix

| Error Type | Network | Auth | Validation | Rate Limit | Server |
|------------|---------|------|------------|------------|--------|
| Retry      | ✅      | ⚠️   | ❌         | ✅         | ✅     |
| Backoff    | Exp     | None | None       | Linear     | Exp    |
| Max Tries  | 3       | 1    | 0          | 5          | 3      |

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Clean up retry timers and promises
- **Request Limiting**: Prevent retry storms
- **Metrics Collection**: Track error rates and response times
- **Background Processing**: Handle error reporting asynchronously

## Testing Scenarios

Your implementation should handle:

1. **Network Failures**: DNS errors, connection timeouts, offline scenarios
2. **Server Errors**: 5xx responses, GraphQL server errors
3. **Authentication Issues**: Token expiry, refresh token flow
4. **Rate Limiting**: Quota exceeded, request throttling
5. **Partial Failures**: Some fields succeed, others fail
6. **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple requests with shared failures

## Success Criteria

✅ **Error Classification**: Correctly categorizes all error types  
✅ **Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff with proper conditions  
✅ **Circuit Breaker**: Manages state transitions and failure thresholds  
✅ **Partial Data**: Extracts maximum value from failed responses  
✅ **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate requests efficiently  
✅ **Recovery**: Attempts multiple recovery strategies  
✅ **Reporting**: Provides comprehensive error information  
✅ **Integration**: All patterns work together seamlessly  
✅ **Testing**: Scenarios validate expected behaviors  
✅ **Performance**: Minimal overhead in success cases

## Advanced Patterns

Consider these enhancements:

- **Adaptive Retry**: Adjust retry parameters based on success rates
- **Predictive Failures**: Use ML to predict and prevent failures
- **Error Correlation**: Group related errors for better insights
- **User Feedback**: Let users report issues and recover manually
- **Monitoring Integration**: Connect with APM and alerting systems

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Retry Storms**: Too aggressive retries overwhelming servers
2. **Memory Leaks**: Not cleaning up timers and promises
3. **Inconsistent States**: Circuit breaker state synchronization issues
4. **Error Masking**: Catching and hiding important errors
5. **User Experience**: Not communicating error states clearly

## Next Steps

After mastering error handling, you'll be ready for:
- Apollo Client setup and configuration
- React hooks integration
- Advanced caching strategies
- Real-time subscriptions with error resilience
