## Advanced MCP Protocol Concepts

### MCP Communication Architecture
```typescript

  client: MCPClient;
  registry: ToolRegistry;
  context: ContextManager;
  transport: TransportLayer;
  security: SecurityManager;
  validator: ProtocolValidator;
}

interface ToolDefinition {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  description: string;
  schema: JSONSchema;
  handler: ToolHandler;
  permissions: Permission[];
  metadata: ToolMetadata;
}
```

### Tool Calling Framework
```typescript
interface ToolCall {
  id: string;
  toolName: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  context: CallContext;

  retries: number;
  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high';
}

interface ToolResult {
  callId: string;
  success: boolean;
  result: any;
  error?: ToolError;
  duration: number;
  resources: ResourceUsage;
  sideEffects: SideEffect[];
}
```

### Context Management System
```typescript
interface ContextState {
  sessionId: string;
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  toolState: Map<string, any>;
  globalContext: GlobalContext;
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  permissionContext: PermissionContext;
}

interface ContextWindow {
  maxSize: number;
  currentSize: number;
