# Microservices Coordination

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (90 minutes)

## Learning Objectives

Master enterprise-scale frontend coordination of microservices architecture including service orchestration, circuit breakers, health monitoring, graceful degradation, and distributed system patterns for resilient applications.

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll implement sophisticated microservices coordination patterns that enable frontend applications to effectively manage and interact with distributed service architectures. You'll work with service orchestration, circuit breaker patterns, comprehensive health monitoring, and graceful degradation strategies - all essential for building resilient, enterprise-scale applications that can handle complex distributed system challenges.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Service Orchestration
- **Request Coordination**: Manage complex multi-service workflows and dependencies
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across service instances intelligently
- **Execution Strategies**: Parallel, sequential, and priority-based request handling
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and endpoint management

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Fault Tolerance**: Prevent cascading failures in distributed systems
- **State Management**: Closed, open, and half-open circuit states
- **Failure Detection**: Threshold-based failure monitoring and automatic recovery
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Resource isolation to prevent total system failure

### 3. Service Monitoring & Health Checks
- **Health Assessment**: Continuous monitoring of service availability and performance
- **Alerting Systems**: Threshold-based alerting with multiple severity levels
- **Metrics Collection**: Response time, error rates, and availability tracking
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request correlation across service boundaries

### 4. Graceful Degradation
- **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple fallback mechanisms for service failures
- **Feature Toggling**: Dynamic feature enablement based on service availability
- **Degradation Levels**: Staged reduction of functionality during outages
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Frontend coordination with service mesh patterns

## Technical Requirements

### ServiceOrchestrator Component
```typescript
interface ServiceOrchestratorProps {
  services: Array<{
    name: string;
    endpoint: string;
    priority: number;
    timeout: number;
    retryAttempts: number;
  }>;
  onServiceResponse: (serviceName: string, response: any) => void;
  onServiceError: (serviceName: string, error: Error) => void;
  onOrchestrationComplete: (results: Map<string, any>) => void;
}
```

**Orchestration Features:**
- Dynamic service discovery and endpoint management
- Multiple load balancing strategies (round-robin, weighted, least-connections)
- Request queuing and concurrent execution limits
- Distributed tracing with request correlation IDs
- Saga pattern support for complex distributed transactions

### CircuitBreaker Component
```typescript
interface CircuitBreakerProps {
  serviceName: string;
  failureThreshold: number;
  timeoutDuration: number;
  monitoringWindow: number;
  onStateChange: (state: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open') => void;
  onFailure: (error: Error) => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

**Circuit Breaker Logic:**
- State machine implementation (closed → open → half-open → closed)
- Failure counting and threshold monitoring within time windows
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Half-open state testing with limited request allowance
- Integration with bulkhead pattern for resource isolation

### ServiceMonitor Component
```typescript
interface ServiceMonitorProps {
  services: Array<{
    name: string;

      responseTime: number;
      errorRate: number;
      availability: number;
    };
  }>;
  onHealthCheck: (serviceName: string, health: any) => void;
  onAlert: (serviceName: string, alert: any) => void;
}
```

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Periodic health checks with configurable intervals
- Multi-dimensional metrics collection (latency, throughput, errors)
- Threshold-based alerting with acknowledgment system
- Service registry integration and dynamic discovery
- Performance trending and anomaly detection

### FallbackProvider Component
```typescript
interface FallbackProviderProps {

  fallbackStrategy: 'sequential' | 'parallel' | 'circuit-breaker';
  degradationLevels: Array<{
    level: number;
    services: string[];
    features: string[];
  }>;
  onFallback: (fromService: string, toService: string) => void;
  onDegradation: (level: number, availableFeatures: string[]) => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

**Degradation Features:**
- Multi-tier degradation with staged feature reduction

## Service Orchestration Patterns

### Load Balancing Strategies
```typescript
// Round Robin Load Balancing
const selectRoundRobinService = (services: Service[], serviceName: string) => {
  const currentIndex = roundRobinIndex.get(serviceName) || 0;
  const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % services.length;
  roundRobinIndex.set(serviceName, nextIndex);
  return services[currentIndex];
};

// Weighted Round Robin (based on response time)
const selectWeightedService = (services: Service[]) => {
  const weights = services.map(service => 1000 / (service.avgResponseTime || 1000));
  const totalWeight = weights.reduce((sum, weight) => sum + weight, 0);
  let random = Math.random() * totalWeight;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < services.length; i++) {
    random -= weights[i];
    if (random <= 0) return services[i];
  }
  return services[0];
};

// Least Connections
const selectLeastConnectionsService = (services: Service[]) => {
  return services.reduce((min, service) => {
    const serviceConnections = activeConnections.get(service.name) || 0;
    const minConnections = activeConnections.get(min.name) || 0;
    return serviceConnections < minConnections ? service : min;
  });
};
```

### Request Correlation and Tracing
```typescript
const executeWithTracing = async (request: ServiceRequest) => {
  const traceId = generateTraceId();
  const spanId = generateSpanId();
  
  const response = await fetch(request.endpoint, {
    method: request.method,
    headers: {
      'X-Trace-ID': traceId,
      'X-Span-ID': spanId,
      'X-Parent-Span-ID': request.parentSpanId,
      'X-Request-ID': request.id,
    },
    body: request.data ? JSON.stringify(request.data) : undefined,
  });
  
  // Log distributed trace
  logTrace({
    traceId,
    spanId,
    service: request.service,
    operation: request.method,
    duration: performance.now() - request.startTime,
    status: response.ok ? 'success' : 'error',
  });
  
  return response;
};
```

## Circuit Breaker Implementation

### State Machine Logic
```typescript
const updateCircuitBreakerState = (
  currentState: CircuitBreakerState,
  success: boolean,
  failureThreshold: number,
  timeoutDuration: number
) => {
  const now = Date.now();
  
  if (success) {
    if (currentState.state === 'half-open') {
      // Successful request in half-open state
      const newSuccessCount = currentState.successCount + 1;
      if (newSuccessCount >= 3) {
        return { ...currentState, state: 'closed', failureCount: 0, successCount: 0 };
      }
      return { ...currentState, successCount: newSuccessCount };
    } else if (currentState.state === 'closed') {
      // Successful request in closed state - reduce failure count
      return { ...currentState, failureCount: Math.max(0, currentState.failureCount - 1) };
    }
  } else {
    // Failed request
    const newFailureCount = currentState.failureCount + 1;
    if (newFailureCount >= failureThreshold) {
      return {
        ...currentState,
        state: 'open',
        failureCount: newFailureCount,
        lastFailureTime: now,
        nextAttemptTime: now + timeoutDuration,
      };
    }
    return { ...currentState, failureCount: newFailureCount, lastFailureTime: now };
  }
  
  return currentState;
};
```

### Sliding Window Failure Rate
```typescript
const calculateFailureRate = (requestHistory: RequestRecord[], windowDuration: number) => {
  const cutoff = Date.now() - windowDuration;
  const recentRequests = requestHistory.filter(req => req.timestamp > cutoff);
  
  if (recentRequests.length === 0) return 0;
  
  const failures = recentRequests.filter(req => !req.success).length;
  return failures / recentRequests.length;
};
```

## Health Monitoring Implementation

### Comprehensive Health Checks
```typescript
const performHealthCheck = async (service: ServiceConfig) => {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(service.healthEndpoint, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: { 'X-Health-Check': 'true' },
      signal: AbortSignal.timeout(service.timeout || 5000),
    });
    
    const responseTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    const healthData = await response.json();
    
    const metrics = {
      responseTime,
      availability: response.ok ? 1 : 0,
      errorRate: response.ok ? 0 : 1,
      throughput: 1 / (responseTime / 1000), // requests per second
      lastCheck: new Date(),
    };
    
    // Check against thresholds
    checkHealthThresholds(service, metrics);
    
    return { ...healthData, metrics };
  } catch (error) {
    const responseTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    return {
      status: 'error',
      error: error.message,
      metrics: {
        responseTime,
        availability: 0,
        errorRate: 1,
        throughput: 0,
        lastCheck: new Date(),
      },
    };
  }
};

const checkHealthThresholds = (service: ServiceConfig, metrics: HealthMetrics) => {
  const { alertThresholds } = service;
  
  if (metrics.responseTime > alertThresholds.responseTime) {
    createAlert(service.name, 'warning', 
      `High response time: ${metrics.responseTime}ms`);
  }
  
  if (metrics.errorRate > alertThresholds.errorRate) {
    createAlert(service.name, 'critical', 
      `High error rate: ${(metrics.errorRate * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
  }
  
  if (metrics.availability < alertThresholds.availability) {
    createAlert(service.name, 'critical', 
      `Low availability: ${(metrics.availability * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
  }
};
```

## Graceful Degradation Strategies

### Multi-Tier Degradation
```typescript
const evaluateDegradationLevel = (serviceHealth: Map<string, boolean>) => {
  const degradationLevels = [
    { level: 0, services: ['core', 'auth', 'data', 'notifications'], features: ['full'] },
    { level: 1, services: ['core', 'auth', 'data'], features: ['essential'] },
    { level: 2, services: ['core', 'auth'], features: ['basic'] },
    { level: 3, services: ['core'], features: ['minimal'] },
  ];
  
  for (const level of degradationLevels) {
    const availableServices = level.services.filter(service => 
      serviceHealth.get(service) === true
    );
    
    if (availableServices.length === level.services.length) {
      return level;
    }
  }
  
  return degradationLevels[degradationLevels.length - 1]; // Worst case
};
```

### Cache-Based Fallbacks
```typescript
const executeWithFallback = async (request: ServiceRequest, fallbackStrategy: string) => {
  try {
    return await executeServiceRequest(request);
  } catch (error) {
    switch (fallbackStrategy) {
      case 'cache':
        const cachedResult = await getCachedResult(request);
        if (cachedResult) return cachedResult;
        break;
        
      case 'static':
        return getStaticFallback(request);
        
      case 'degraded':
        return getDegradedResponse(request);
        
      case 'queue':
        await queueForLaterExecution(request);
        return getQueuedResponse();
    }
    
    throw error; // Re-throw if no fallback available
  }
};
```
