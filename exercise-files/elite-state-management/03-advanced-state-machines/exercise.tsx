// Advanced State Machines with XState
// Master complex state machines using XState for bulletproof state management

import React from 'react';
import { createMachine, interpret, assign, send, spawn, ActorRefFrom } from 'xstate';
import { useMachine, useActor } from '@xstate/react';

// Learning objectives:
// - Model complex business logic as hierarchical state machines
// - Integrate XState with React and TypeScript for type-safe state management
// - Design parallel state machines and actor communication
// - Implement guards, actions, and services
// - Handle machine-to-machine communication and spawning
// - Test state machines comprehensively with all edge cases

// TODO: Create authentication state machine, file upload machine, shopping cart machine, etc.
// (Implementation similar to what I was writing, but focused on XState patterns rather than discriminated unions)
