## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### For Creating New Exercise Sections

1. **Review the Template**: Read `EXERCISE_SECTION_TEMPLATE.md` thoroughly
2. **Plan Your Exercises**: Use the planning checklist in `EXERCISE_CREATION_GUIDE.md`
3. **Follow the Structure**: Implement the exact directory structure and file standards
4. **Leverage the Test System**: Use helpers from `test-utils.ts` for consistent testing

### For Adding Individual Exercises

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure the category exists and follows template structure
2. **Use the Generator**: Follow automated creation workflow in `EXERCISE_CREATION_GUIDE.md`
3. **Test Integration**: Verify the modular test system loads your tests correctly
4. **Quality Check**: Meet all standards outlined in the template documentation

- Progress tracking and user analytics
- Interactive demonstrations and live coding
- Community contributions and content review system

## üéì Learning Path Integration

### **Foundation Level** (Difficulty 1-2)
- Basic concepts and syntax
- Single-concept focus
- Guided implementation with extensive hints

### **Integration Level** (Difficulty 3-4)  
- Multiple concepts combined
- Real-world application patterns
- Independent problem-solving with minimal guidance

### **Mastery Level** (Difficulty 5)
- Complex architectural patterns
- Performance and optimization considerations
- Expert-level implementations and edge cases

## üîß Tools and Utilities

### **Exercise Creation**
```bash
# Use the generator (when implemented)
npm run create-exercise

# Manual creation following template
mkdir -p src/exercises/[category]/[nn-exercise-name]
mkdir -p exercise-files/[category]/[nn-exercise-name]
```

### **Testing and Validation**
```bash
# Development server with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Validate exercise structure
npm run validate:exercises

# Run specific exercise tests
npm run test:exercise [category] [exercise-id]
```

### **Quality Assurance**
```bash
# Check template compliance
npm run check:template-compliance

# Validate test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Build and verify all exercises
npm run build:exercises
```
