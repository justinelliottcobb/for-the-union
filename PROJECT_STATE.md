## Exercise Categories Status

### ✅ Discriminated Unions (Complete)
- **Status:** Production ready, 2 exercises
- **Exercises:** Traffic Light States, Geometric Shapes
- **Difficulty:** 2-3/5, 15-25 minutes each
- **Focus:** Foundation patterns, exhaustive checking, type guards

### ✅ React Hooks (Complete)
- **Status:** Production ready, 6 exercises
- **Exercises:** 
  1. useState Fundamentals (2/5, 20min)
  2. useEffect Lifecycle (3/5, 30min) 
  3. useContext Data Sharing (3/5, 25min)
  4. Custom Hooks Creation (4/5, 35min)
  5. useRef Caching & Performance (4/5, 30min)
  6. useEffect Data Preloading (5/5, 40min)
- **Focus:** Progressive hooks mastery from basics to advanced patterns

### 🚧 Elite State Management (1/3 Complete)
- **Status:** First exercise complete, 2 more planned
- **Completed:**
  1. ✅ useReducer with Discriminated Union Patterns (5/5, 45min)
- **Planned:**
  2. ⏳ Redux with Discriminated Union Actions (5/5, 50min)
  3. ⏳ Advanced State Machines with XState (5/5, 55min)
- **Focus:** Advanced patterns combining discriminated unions with state management

## Recent Development Activity

### Latest Commits (Most Recent)
1. **`c50def1`** - Add elite-tier useReducer + discriminated unions exercise
   - Complete asyncReducer, shoppingCartReducer, formWizardReducer, timeTravelReducer
   - Custom hooks: useAsyncOperation, useShoppingCart, useFormWizard, useTimeTravel
   - Helper functions for calculations and validations

2. **Previous** - React hooks exercises with caching and preloading patterns
3. **Previous** - Initial React hooks curriculum (useState through custom hooks)
4. **Previous** - Complete TypeScript exercise system foundation

### Key Implementation Details

#### Elite Exercise (useReducer + Discriminated Unions)
- **File:** `exercise-files/elite-state-management/01-usereducer-patterns/exercise.ts`
- **Features:**
  - 4 complex reducers with real-world business logic
  - Shopping cart with checkout phases and totals calculation
  - Form wizard with step validation and accessibility
  - Time travel debugging with history management
  - Async operations with retry and error handling
- **TypeScript Patterns:** Exhaustive checking, discriminated union actions/states, generic reducers

## Known Issues & Technical Notes

### Build Warnings (Non-blocking)
- JSX syntax errors in React hooks solution files (expected, solutions contain JSX)
- Main exercise system compiles cleanly
- Elite exercises TypeScript compilation verified

### Architecture Decisions
- **Exercise Files:** Kept in `exercise-files/` for direct student editing
- **Solutions:** In `src/exercises/` for reference (contain JSX build issues)
- **TODO-Driven Learning:** Students fill TODOs with implementations
- **Modular Configuration:** Each category has own config file imported by useExercises hook

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Exercises
1. Create directory: `exercise-files/{category}/{id}/`
2. Create `exercise.ts` with TODO-driven structure
3. Create instructions in `src/exercises/{category}/{id}/instructions.md`
4. Update category config in `src/exercises/{category}/config.ts`
5. Import category in `src/hooks/useExercises.ts`

### Exercise Structure Pattern
```typescript
// Types and interfaces (discriminated unions)
// TODO comments for student implementation
// Function stubs with TODO instructions
// Export statements for testing
```

### CLI Usage
- **Scaffold Exercise:** `npm run create-exercise`
- **Development:** `npm run dev` (auto-reload on changes)
- **Build Check:** `npm run build` (ignore JSX solution errors)

## Next Development Priorities

### Immediate (Elite State Management)
1. **Redux Patterns Exercise** - Redux Toolkit with discriminated union actions
2. **State Machines Exercise** - XState integration with TypeScript
3. **Testing Infrastructure** - Add comprehensive test suites

### Future Categories (Potential)
- Advanced TypeScript Patterns
- Performance Optimization
- Error Handling & Resilience
- API Integration Patterns

## Learning Progression Path
1. **Foundation:** Discriminated Unions → Type safety fundamentals
2. **React Integration:** React Hooks → State management in components  
3. **Advanced Patterns:** Elite State Management → Complex application architecture

**Current Status:** Ready for elite-tier state management development. First exercise complete and committed. System architecture proven and scalable.
