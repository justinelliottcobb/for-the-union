# Claude Code Session Context

## Quick Resume
**Project:** TypeScript Exercises (Rustlings-style learning platform)  
**Repo:** `git@github.com:justinelliottcobb/for-the-union.git`  
**Branch:** `feature/react-hooks-exercises`  
**Dir:** `/home/sisawat/working/web/for-the-union`

## Stack
React 18 + TypeScript + Mantine UI v7 + Vite + file watching

## Status
- âœ… **Discriminated Unions** (2/2 exercises) - Foundation patterns
- âœ… **React Hooks** (6/6 exercises) - useState â†’ advanced preloading  
- ðŸš§ **Elite State Management** (1/3 exercises) - useReducer + discriminated unions
- âœ… **Runtime Dependencies** - All browser console errors resolved

## Last Session Output
- **MAJOR**: Fixed all runtime dependency issues blocking development
- Resolved Mantine modals CSS missing import (`@mantine/modals/styles.css` â†’ included in core)
- Fixed Tabler icons export errors (`IconPlayerPlayFilled` â†’ `IconPlayerPlay`, `IconPlay` â†’ `IconPlayerPlay`)
- Resolved `process is not defined` errors with proper Vite Node.js polyfills
- Created browser-compatible `FileWatcher` class (removed chokidar dependency)
- Dashboard renders successfully with zero console errors
- Previous: `01-usereducer-patterns` exercise (5/5 difficulty, 45min)

## Next Tasks  
1. Resume `02-redux-discriminated-patterns` exercise (Redux Toolkit + discriminated unions)
2. `03-advanced-state-machines` exercise (XState integration)  
3. Test infrastructure improvements
4. Consider implementing alternative file watching mechanism for browser environment

## Key Files
- `src/hooks/useExercises.ts` - Category management
- `src/exercises/*/config.ts` - Exercise configurations  
- `exercise-files/` - Student TODO-driven exercises
- `scripts/create-exercise.ts` - CLI scaffolding
- `src/lib/file-watcher.ts` - Browser-compatible file watching (no longer uses chokidar)
- `vite.config.ts` - Node.js polyfills and dependency exclusions

## Dev Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (now error-free)
- `npm run create-exercise` - Scaffold new exercise
- **Status**: Main system compiles and runs clean, all runtime errors resolved

## Architecture Notes
- TODO-driven learning pattern
- Discriminated unions â†’ React integration â†’ Advanced state patterns
- Exercise progression: Foundation (2-3/5) â†’ Integration (3-4/5) â†’ Elite (5/5)
